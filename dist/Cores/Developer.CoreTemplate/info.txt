Example Core - A440

This is a test core showing a test pattern and playing an A440 tone. You should see a grid of pixels, and these colors at the edges:

Top: Red
Bottom: Blue
Left: Green
Right: Yellow

In the center, you should see either a grid of white and magenta pixels (when handheld) or a grid of black and magenta pixels (when docked). The app should fill the screen completely in both handheld and docked modes (note: dock detection requires firmware 1.2).

There are some debug controls:
   D-pad UP: Force grid to white
   D-pad DOWN: Force grid to black
   Select: Simulate "swapping" the dock. If docked, it will act like it is not docked. If undocked (or running firmware 1.1) it will act like it is docked.
   Y: Switch checkerboard to plain magenta
   X: Switch checkerboard to vertical lines
   A: Switch checkerboard to horizontal lines
   B: Switch checkerboard to checkerboard
